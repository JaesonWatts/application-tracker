# README

This web application is a rails app designed to allow me to track my job applications and the status of each.
I wrote this app as a full stack Ruby on Rails application. This was written on my own time after I graduated from Flatiron School.  I realized that I was applying to upwards of 100+ jobs a day, on various sites. I needed a way to track all these jobs in one spot. I designed this app to allow me to add companies, open positions, and track my applications. In the next phase I am adding interview tracking, metrics, and adding the capacity to log in to the linkedin API and access that data directly. Additional APIs such as Glassdoor are a stretch goal. Currently login in is handled via Oauth2.0(omniauth) with a google strategy implemented.

This project was initialized with PostgreSQL for data management. This project was written with Ruby 2.7.0 & Rails 6.0.3.
